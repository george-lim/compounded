# Introduction
You're a police officer who catches wanted criminals on the street. HQ has given you suspect descriptions and it is up to you to catch the cars with the correct license plate - but there's a catch.

All license plates are chemical formulae and all suspect descriptions are chemical equations. Balance and solve the chemical equation to determine the suspect's license plate! See how many suspects you can catch before time runs out and make your way to the top of the local leaderboards!

# Installation
This game is ready to be played! The files represent a CD rip of the game but you can start playing if you have Java installed on your computer by navigating to `/src/` and executing `Compounded.jar`.
